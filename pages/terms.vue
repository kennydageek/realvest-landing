                For purposes of this Terms and Conditions, “disparage” shall
                mean any negative statement, whether written or oral, about
                Realvest, and any other associated products and trademarks.
              </p>
              <p>
                Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to or shall

                You hereby agree unequivocally that if a breach were to occur,
                it would be difficult to determine actual damages. Based on what
                is presently known, You and Realvest agree that ₦25,000,000 .00
                (Twenty-Five Million Naira Only), is a reasonable estimate of
                the damages that would accrue if a breach occurred in the
                future. This amount of liquidated damages is fair and reasonable
                and would not act as a penalty to the breaching party.
              </p>
              <p>
                You also agree that this non-disparagement provision is a
                material term of these Terms and Conditions, and also agree that
                even after the completion of the obligations herein, it will
                survive and subsist.
